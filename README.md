Welcome to the Lara-India (Larachat ) activity. 

The task is described as follows:

> We are creating a demo app called Teammate. It tracks the games played by users. The game is a single player game and 
we store the score in the database. 

> Create a table that displays all the users with their scores of their last 5 games. 

What to do:

1. The migrations, models, relationships, and controller have been created already. Enter some data into the tables (Seeder wasn't working will fix it )

2. In `UserController` write an eloquent query that fetches the last 5 scores of each user. 

3. Create a table in the blade view that shows all the users and their last 5 games 


How to do:

1. Fork this project. Install all the dependencies (run `composer install`)

2. Edit the `.env` file with database credentials

3. After finishing, submit a Pull Request to this repo. 

Rules & Tips:

1. Use Eloquent and existing relationships. Avoid using raw queries, joins or query builder

2. Focus on functionality. UI is not important

3. Tests are not mandatory but writing one will be appreciated.
